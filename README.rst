=====================================
Kinesis Spark Streaming Source Plugin
=====================================

Introduction
============
Amazon Kinesis spark streaming source.

Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
--------------
CDAP version 3.5.x or higher.

Building Plugins
----------------
You get started with Kinesis spark streaming source plugin by building directly from the latest source code::

   git clone git@github.com:hydrator/Kinesis-sparkStreamingSource.git
   cd Kinesis-sparkStreamingSource
   mvn clean package

After the build completes, you will have a JAR for each plugin under each
``Kinesis-sparkStreamingSource/target/`` directory.

Deploying Plugins
-----------------
You can deploy a plugin using the CDAP CLI::

  > load artifact <target/plugin-jar> config-file <resources/plugin-config>

  > load artifact target/kinesis-sparkstreamingsource-plugin-<version>.jar \
         config-file target/kinesis-sparkstreamingsource-plugin-<version>.json

You can build without running tests: ``mvn clean install -DskipTests``

Limitations
-----------
- UI doesn't support schema's with hyphens (-), so the plugin currently transforms all the schemas with - into underscores (_). This change will be reverted after this is fixed: https://issues.cask.co/browse/HYDRATOR-1125

Mailing Lists
-------------
CDAP User Group and Development Discussions:

- `cdap-user@googlegroups.com <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/cdap-user>`__

The *cdap-user* mailing list is primarily for users using the product to develop
applications or building plugins for appplications. You can expect questions from

to the users.
